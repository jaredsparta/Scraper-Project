## Dev Environments
- As Ansible does not work on Windows machines, we can use a virtual machine to run Ubuntu and install Ansible there. It follows that we can use Vagrant boxes as an easy way to do this

- The `.venv` included within the repository is a Python virtual environment that has all the necessary dependencies for the code to run
    1. `python3 -m pip install bs4`
    2. `python3 -m pip install requests`
    3. `python3 -m pip install pytest`
    4. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
